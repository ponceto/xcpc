Description: Amstrad CPC emulator
 Xcpc is a portable Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128 emulator written in C and C++.
 .
 It is designed to run on any POSIX compliant system having an X11 server,
 including Linux, BSD and Unix.
 .
 Xcpc is designed to emulate classic range of the Amstrad CPC systems:
 Amstrad CPC 464 (v1), Amstrad CPC 664 (v2), Amstrad CPC 6128 (v3).
 .
 The Amstrad CPC+ range and the GX4000 console are not currently emulated
 and likely will not be.
