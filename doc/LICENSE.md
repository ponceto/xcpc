### Third party code

This software is very partly based on the Z80 emulator from Marat Fayzullin.

  - http://www.komkon.org/fms/

A complete rewrite of the Z80 emulator is in progress.

The new core will not contain any source code from the original Marat's implementation and will be available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
