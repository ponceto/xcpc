## How to install Xcpc

The xcpc emulator is fully autotoolized.

Under Debian or derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, ...), please install first these dependencies

```
build-essential
autoconf
automake
libtool
git
xorg-dev
libmotif-dev
libglib2.0-dev
```

Generate the `configure` script

```
autoreconf -v -i -f
```

Run the `configure` script

```
./configure --prefix={destination-path}
```

Build the emulator

```
make -j4
```

Install the emulator

```
make install
```

Run the emulator

```
{destination-path}/bin/xcpc
```

A XDG compliant `.desktop` file is provided, so you can copy or symlink this file in a relevant directory

For example, in the system directory

```
ln -sf {destination-path}/share/applications/xcpc.desktop /usr/share/applications/xcpc.desktop
```

For example, or the user directory

```
ln -sf {destination-path}/share/applications/xcpc.desktop ${HOME}/.local/share/applications/xcpc.desktop
```

## How to install into your home directory

Quick installation instructions

```
autoreconf -v -i -f
./configure --prefix=${HOME}/Apps/xcpc
make -j4
make install
ln -sf {HOME}/Apps/xcpc/share/applications/xcpc.desktop ${HOME}/.local/share/applications/xcpc.desktop
```

You can now run the emulator from your desktop menu `Games > Xcpc`

## Release notes

  * Xcpc doesn't have sound emulation yet.
  * You can emulate the joystick with the keypad by disabling the 'Num Lock' key.

The joystick mode can be toggled (enabled/disabled) by pressing the `End` key.
The Up/Down/Left/Right + CTRL-L & ALT-L keys will then emulate the joystick 0.
